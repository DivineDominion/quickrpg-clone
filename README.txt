SOME INFO
---------
All resources were created in Oct 2001. I know I did the house tiles
by myself, looking at Final Fantasy VI a lot to imitate their patterns.
The walls were kind of copied from Final Fantasy V, the grass I don't
know anymore. Bushes, trees ugly sand, mushy paths and all character
sprites were my very own creation as far as I can remember.
The text box (at least its colors) was ripped from a QuickBasic4.5 
RPG demo called "Untitled by "Tsugumo" (Jeff Hangartner, IIRC) and his
friend FrozenEmu.
