LICENCE
=======

Please take a look at LICENSE.txt for further information. Don't quote
me on that one, but I think I basically granted full free Open Source
access to the code. Use and modify it, "fork" my repository etc. but 
keep in mind: I'd really like to know what you did to the code and how
you used it. Because I want to feel useful, regarded, respected and
the like, you know.


KEY CONTROLS
============

  [KEY]           [FUNCTION]
  (arrow keys)    Control the player
  space           Activate/trigger stuff in the world, make choices in text
                  dialogues
  esc             Quits the game
  d	              Show/hide debug information (grid, hotspot markers etc)
  f	              Show/hide frame rate


SOME INFO ON GRAPHICS
=====================

All resources were created in Oct 2001. I know I did the house tiles
by myself, looking at Final Fantasy VI a lot to imitate their patterns.
The walls were kind of copied from Final Fantasy V, the grass I don't
know anymore. Bushes, trees ugly sand, mushy paths and all character
sprites were my very own creation as far as I can remember.

The text box (at least its colors) was ripped from a QuickBASIC 4.5 
RPG demo called "Untitled" by Tsugumo (= Jeff Hangartner, IIRC) and his
friend FrozenEmu. These two I owe a lot: Tsugumo and FrozenEmu answered
some dumb questions about scripting, file I/O, game logic and the like
waaaaaay back in 1999--2000 or so, when I still fought with QuickBASIC.

  Visit <http://divinedominion.art-fx.org/> for more links, 
  downloads and infos on my projects and me.
  Also give <http://christiantietze.de/> a try if I happen to
  have changed my mind and discontinued art-fx.org.

Take care,
